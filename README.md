## Song Metadata Visualizer
This application is a web-based interactive visualization system enabling users to compare music, genre, and artist in terms of their metadata (acousticness, energy, danceability, etc.). Using this visualization system users can also select certain music and find similar music in terms of its audio features. Also, it visualizes the music changes from 1920 to 2021.
