## Song Metadata Visualizer
This application is a web-based interactive visualization system enabling users to compare music, genre, and artist in terms of their metadata (acousticness, energy, danceability, etc.). Using this visualization system users can also select certain music and find similar music in terms of its audio features. Moreover, a platform has been considered for the composers to see the music changes from 1920 to 2021. This data visualization lends a hand to them in order to update themselves with the trends and song listeners' needs.
